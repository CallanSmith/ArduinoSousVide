The Psuedo code gives us a clear outline for the code, which will help greatly in the long run.

### Onshape Link

### Onshape Progress
I added a button to the assembly that would turn the tempature sensor on.
Also, I added a Led that would turn on when the tempature reached the desired heat.
I am not totally sure whether we will be able to finish on time or not.
