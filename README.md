### Psuedo Code
In Psuedocode.ino file
#### Description
The Psuedo code gives us a clear outline for the code, which will help greatly in the long run.

### Onshape Progress
3/1:

I added a button to the assembly that would turn the tempature sensor on.
Also, I added a Led that would turn on when the tempature reached the desired heat.
I am not totally sure whether we will be able to finish on time or not.

3/19:

I made a final box that has connecters and has the correct demensions and should be able to be printed.

### Hows the project going?  Are you on time?
 For the coding part of the project I feel like I am on time. I have connected the Temp sesnor to the LCD and it is printing the reading.
 
 
### What major obstacle is keeping you from making better progress on your project?
 For the coding, I am trying to figure out how to code a timer to start when the tempature reading reaches a certain tempature. I coded a timer, but the tempature sensor code is connected to a different library, so im not sure to code that.
 
 ###  "When I return from Spring break
I will add a piezo buzzer to the temp sesnor, so it will be able to alert the user when their deeisred tempature has been reached, and when the timer is up.

### Onshape completion assembly & final box finished early may, documented 5/27
The box after lots of changes and refining was finished and laser cut and even though there had to be two changes that were made manually after it was laser cut I felt that I did a fairly good job in the design and the final product, while not perfect works well enough now that it has been all assembled.
